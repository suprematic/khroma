# Khroma

Khroma is a ClojureScript library which provides access to Chrome Extension API. It wraps API with ideomatic functions 
and heavilly uses core.async for asynchronious API interaction.

Khroma is still a work in progress, so not all API is implemented and well tested. The long term goal is to cover all Chrome 
and Chrome OS API's to make use of ClojureScript for extensions and applications development as convinient as possible.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

```clojure
[khroma "0.0.3-SNAPSHOT"]
```

## Usage Example

```clojure
(ns example
  (:require [khroma.runtime :as runtime))
  
  
; receieve messages for extension  
(let [messages (runtime/messages)]
  (go-loop [] 
    (when-let [message (<! messages)]
      (process-message message)
      (recur)))
      
; send message to anoher extension      
(runtime/send-message 
   {:message-data "xx" :something-else "yyy"}
   {:extensionId "some.other.extension"
    :responseCallback 
      (fn [response]
        (handle-response response))})
```
